 The entry point name was wrong (it referred to "tm").  Change it so
 that egg:repoze.retry#retry should work in paste configs.

 Depend on zopelib rather than ZODB 3.8.0b3 distribution, because the
 ZODB distribution pulls in various packages (zope.interface and ZEO
 most notably) that are incompatible with stock Zope 2.10.4 apps and
 older sandboxes.  We'll need to revisit this.
